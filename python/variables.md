# Variables in Python

## 📌 What I learned
- How to define variables in Python
- Basic naming rules and conventions
- That variables can store different types of data

## 🧠 Notes
Variables are used to store values in Python.  
You can assign a value to a variable using the `=` operator.

Python variable names should be descriptive and use `snake_case`.

## 🧪 Examples
```python
x = 10
name = "Chengyan"
is_active = True

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes
- Using reserved keywords as variable names
- Forgetting that Python is case-sensitive
- Overusing unclear variable names like a, b, or x
